# Python Gallery Duplicate Deleter
This is a program written in Python to delete repeated images in a gallery

The final project for my course at Python School, titled "Python for Non-Programmers", revolved around the design and implementation of a Python program that identifies and deletes duplicate images in a gallery. This real-world utility application demonstrated the powerful capabilities of Python in practical problem-solving situations.

For the completion of this project I used the Pillow library 

This software works by scanning through the folders of the gallery (seagulls and images), identifying images with matching properties. By searching for identical visual data, rather than simply checking for duplicate filenames. Once a match is detected, the program suggests the user the removal of duplicated images, effectively optimizing gallery space and organization.
