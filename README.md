# Python Gallery Duplicate Deleter
This is a program written in Python to delete repeated images in a gallery

The final project for my course at Python School, titled "Python for Non-Programmers", revolved around the design and implementation of a Python program that identifies and deletes duplicate images in a gallery. This real-world utility application demonstrated the powerful capabilities of Python in practical problem-solving situations.

This software works by scanning through a digital gallery, identifying images with matching properties. In essence, the program searches for identical visual data, rather than simply checking for duplicate filenames. Once a match is detected, the program proceeds to delete the duplicated images, effectively optimizing gallery space and organization.
